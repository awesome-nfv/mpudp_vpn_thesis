This folder has the various Python scripts used to analyze 
the tests and generate the graphs used.  These scripts 
could be optimized further since they have a lot of repeated 
code.  If you would like to submit new code, I would be happy 
to update.  Here is a brief overview of the
scripts:

* **parser\_cubic\_balia\_mpudp.py:** Python script used to 
parse csv files and produce bar graphs from Sections 
3.1.4, 3.1.5, and 4.2.
    
* **parser\_fullmesh\_norm.py** and **parser\_ndiff\_norm.py:** 
Python script used for producing the subflow 
Figures 3.7 and 3.8.

* **parser\_asym.py:** Python script used for producing 
asymmetric Figure 3.9.
